# Web Visualization Dashboard


## Background

For this project, I created a visualization dashboard website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I created visualizations for the project by analyzing data on fatal police shootings from The WashintonPost (https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings). To analyze the data, I used Pandas, numpy, and Matplotlib. For the website, I created 9 responsive pages, including a the home/landing page.
